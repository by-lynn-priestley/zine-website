# Repository for the Body Language Zine Archive website

This zine was started as a school project for a digital composition class, where we were allowed to pick our topic and mode of composition for a 10-week school project. As someone deeply interested in disability studies, I chose to research the construct of the body norm, given the history of the medical institution's attempts to pathologize disabled bodies for their "abnormality". For the project mode, I wanted to create the first issue of my zine and corresponding website (for accessibility and archiving purposes), to give this project the space to grow into more nuanced issues in the future. This is the repository for that site, hosted through GH pages.
