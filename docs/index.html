        <h2>an introduction to the project:</h2>
          <p>Language fascinates me. So much of what we perceive to be foundational truths in our society are spoken or written into existence, then have their origins veiled with another few words: "It's always been this way."
          <p>But often, it hasn't. Often, in our human desire to make sense of our information dense world, we hastily categorize and label in ways that are more reductive than we'd care to admit.</p>
          <p>Body Language is a zine that I wanted to center around the idea of peeling back the labels we've attached to bodies and unpacking the categorized boxes. What's really true, and what's a construct? How does our language shape our conceptualization of bodies? How do our words, our language about bodies, shape our posturing towards each other, our body language?</p>
          <p>This zine was started as a school project for a digital composition class, where we were allowed to pick our topic and mode of composition for a 10-week school project. As someone deeply interested in disability studies, I chose to research the construct of the body norm, given the history of the medical institution's attempts to pathologize disabled bodies for their "abnormality". For the project mode, I wanted to create a zine. But in the process of creating it, I realized how much nuance there was to the history of how we talk about bodies. One zine could never be enough. So I decided to make my class project an introductory issue and an archiving site, to give this project the space to grow into more nuanced issues in the future. For now, though, that initial issue can be found in the archive section below. It's time we talk about how we talk about bodies.</p>

      <h3>issue 1: the body "norm"</h3>
      <h4>fall 2020</h4>
      <p>How did an astronomer play a part in determing the norm? Why do we say "ahead of the curve"? How has the idea of a normal body and mind persisted? What can we do to change how we conceptualize bodies?

        As a young adult with a chronic illness, I have found myself on the receiving end of the phrase "But you're too young to be sick."

      <h5>half-page version</h5>
        <p>This version will produce a 5.5" by 8.5" zine out of 3 sheets of folded paper. For the final, stapled version to make sense, the pages in the document are arranged out of order. If you want to access the zine with a screen reader, see the full-page version below.</p>
