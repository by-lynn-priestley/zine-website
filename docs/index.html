        <h2>an introduction to the project:</h2>
          <p>This zine was started as a school project for a digital composition class, where we were allowed to pick our topic and mode of composition for a 10-week school project. As someone deeply interested in disability studies and cultural constructs surrounding bodies, I chose to research the construct of the body norm and created the first issue of this zine, as well as the archiving site. That issue can be found in the archive section below.</p>

      <p>As a young adult with a chronic illness, I have found myself on the receiving end of the phrase "But you're too young to be sick."
