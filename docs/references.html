    <h1 id='main'>the references page</h1>
    <p>This page contains a list of readings that inform the theory behind the zine's content. While I have compiled and synthesized ideas from a variety of fields, ranging from disability studies to psychology to design, to create the written content, illustrations, and overall narrative flow of the zine, the ideas explained in the zine come from scholars who are experts in their respective fields. I highly encourage anyone interested to read from this list, as the zine is meant to be an introduction and therefore cannot capture all of the rich nuances of the topics explored in the zine.</p>
    <p>It also has links to tools used in composing each zine issue (and the website), as well as Fair Use statements for any images used as references for an issue's artwork.</p>

    <h3>fair use check:</h3>
      <p>I created a Fair Use Check (for images I made handmade copies of, found on two of the pages in the zine). This can be viewed by clicking on the following <a href='../downloads/FairUseCheckforImages.docx'>link to download my Fair Use Check document</a>.
    <h3>acknowledgements:</h3>
      <p>In the spirit of shattering the "self-made" myth, I would like to thank the people who helped in the process making this zine. I could not have made the project what it is without the assistance of Angie Bedford-Jack (who helped with digital accessibility expertise), Lauren Collister (who provided Fair Use information and advice), Megan Kappel (who gave inclusive design feedback for important elements like contrast), and Camarie Shepard (who reviewed the zine as a disability advocate). I would also like to thank the friends and family who reviewed drafts as the zine developed and acted as my focus group, putting up with many, <em>many</em> questions about their opinions on "this diagram's logic" or "that ordering of information making sense". I am incredibly grateful to have been able to rely on the interdependence of humans to produce this zine.</p>
